    "In this notebook we learn about optimisation methods in HCI by applying them to a classic optimisation problem: keyboard layouting. We use this example to learn about the following aspects of computational interface design:\n",
    "1. Formulating an HCI design problem as an optimisation problem.\n",
    "2. Creating an appropriate objective function for our design goals.\n",
    "3. Creating an optimiser to search the design space for a better design.\n",

    "1. First, we formulate an appropriate **objective function**, including a model for estimating user performance. This allows us to estimate how fast users may type with a given keyboard layout (i.e. how \"good\" the layout is).\n",

    "In this notebook we learned about optimisation methods in HCI by applying them to the classic problem of keyboard layouting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we formulated an **objective function**, considering finger movement times and character frequencies in the English language. This function thus estimated how fast users may type with a given keyboard layout. This was our measure of \"goodness\" for keyboard layouts\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Second, we implemented two **optimisation algorithms** that used the objective function to find a good keyboard layout. We started with a very simple approach, random search, followed by a meta-heuristic approach called Simulated Annealing. This allowed us to find a new layout that was predicted to be faster than the common QWERTY layout."
